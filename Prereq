## Connecting github with Jenkins using webhooks.
In this section, we'll explore how to establish a seamless integration between GitHub and Jenkins by setting up webhooks. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a powerful automated system that triggers Jenkins jobs whenever changes are pushed to your GitHub repository. Let's get started and streamline your development workflow! üõ†Ô∏èüîó

- ### Install Jenkins Plugins: 
Ensure that you have the necessary plugins installed on your Jenkins server to support GitHub integration. Popular plugins include "GitHub Plugin" and "GitHub Webhook."

- ### Get github personal token.

To obtain a GitHub personal access token, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your GitHub account.

2. Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner of the page and select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.

3. In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings."

4. Then, click on "Personal access tokens."

5. Next, click on the "Generate new token" button.

6. You'll be prompted to provide your account password for security purposes.

7. After entering your password, you'll see the "New personal access token" page.

8. Here, you can give your token a meaningful name and configure the required permissions for the token.

9. Make sure to select the appropriate scopes based on the actions you want to perform with the token. For example, if you're integrating Jenkins with GitHub, you might need "repo" and "admin:repo_hook" scopes.

10. Once you've configured the settings, click the "Generate token" button at the bottom of the page.

11. GitHub will generate the personal access token. Make sure to copy and save it somewhere secure, as you won't be able to see it again.

Remember that personal access tokens are sensitive information and should be treated with care. Avoid sharing them publicly or storing them in version control repositories. Instead, use tools like environment variables or secret management systems to store and use them securely within your applications or automation scripts.
